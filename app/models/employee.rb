  having issue when admin try to create new employee it shows "You are already signed in" it's happening because RegistrationsController#create only 
  allows self-registration, meaning logged-in users (admins) cannot create employees using Devise's default flow. Deviseâ€™s RegistrationsController 
  includes a before_action :require_no_authentication, which prevents signed-in users from signing up another user. So I added custom 
  controller to override devise native behaviour. Now admin can create new employee however I see another issue. And that is when employee try to self register
  after click sign_up button, next page comes is the login page again.
